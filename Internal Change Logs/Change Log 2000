<change-section-head> Changes </change-section-head>

<change-date> 2000.6.3 </change-date>
<change>
	Added BlockElementSelection::ReplaceContents(), moving the code from AcceptKey().
	Added CanPaste() and Paste() so it now supports pasting.  Same for InlineElementSelection.
	Same for BetweenBlocksSelection, except the new method is called InsertText().  Same
	for GlyphsSelection, except the new method is called ReplaceText().
</change>
<change>
	Made DisplayDirector::Paste() do a refresh cycle.  (A)
</change>


<change-date> 2000.4.20 </change-date>
<change>
	Changed MessageParser::Parse() to remove empty texts from empty headers, so
	that placeholder texts will be used.  (It took two rounds to get the code the way
	I wanted it.)
</change>


<change-date> 2000.4.19 </change-date>
<change>
	Changed System::OutgoingNewsDirectory() to always create
	"/boot/home/Documents/Usenet Binaries" even if "/boot/home/Documents" doesn't exist.
</change>
<change>
	Fixed uninitialized variables in the MessageFileSource(Document*) ctor, adding
	"isNewMessageIn" default argument, and making Reply() pass it.  This fixes a bug
	that caused replies to sometimes not have the "Sent/Unsent" status show up.
</change>
<change>
	Added RefreshAll() methods to DisplayDirector and subclasses.  Made
	MessageFileSource::Post() and Send() call it so the status control gets updated.
</change>
<change>
	Changed MessageFileSource::AttachedToDirector() to select empty titles.  (2000.4.20.A)
</change>


<change-date> 2000.4.12 </change-date>
<change>
	Outgoing mail messages now get their "Subject" and "When" attributes set.  (2000.4.13.A)
</change>
<change>
	Changed ctors of ChangeElementTagNameAction and NewElementAction to take DOMStrings
	for the tag names instead of string_slices.  This should fix a bug where that put
	garbage in the tags.  Also made InsertTag() methods of PointSelection and subclasses
	take the tag name as a DOMString rt a string_slice.  (2000.4.13.B)
</change>
<change>
	Changed TagSelection::AcceptKey() so it doesn't try to call TagEditChanged() if the
	tag name changed, since the selection and the tag will go away in that case.
</change>
<change>
	Changed BlocksSelection::AcceptKey() so it ignores the tab key.  (2000.4.13.C)
</change>


<change-date> 2000.4.5 </change-date>
<change>
	Removed the NewDocWind stuff, which was left over from EE1 and unused.  (2000.04.06.B)
</change>
<change>
	Made outgoing mail go to ~/mail/out, instead of ~/Documents/Mail.  Still need to
	set "Subject" and "When" attributes (at least) to be nice.
</change>
<change>
	Fixed a bug in WindowDirector::KeyDown(), which needed to detach the action string
	before deleting the "menuDocSource".  (2000.04.06.C)
</change>


<change-date> 2000.4.3 </change-date>
<change>
	Ported to Intel.  (2000.04.06.A)
</change>


<change-date> 2000.3.9 </change-date>
<change>
	Added rudimentary (text-only) paste capabilities.  Changed EnglishEditorView::MessageReceived(),
	and added DisplayDirector::Paste().  Added CanPaste() and Paste() methods to Selection,
	CharacterSelection, BetweenGlyphsSelection, BetweenWordsSelection, and
	EmptyPlaceholderSelection.  (A)
</change>


<change-date> 2000.2.27 </change-date>
<change>
	Added "Sent/Unsent" indicator for emails.  Changes to StatusControl, DisplayDirector,
	and MessageFileSource.  (A)
</change>


<change-date> 2000.2.3 </change-date>
<change>
	Minor changes due to the renaming/moving of DOMString (in Unified DOM) to String (in
	Strings).  (A)
</change>


<change-date> 2000.1.9 </change-date>
<change>
	Changed file type info to accept any text file (although this doesn't seem to work
	yet...we'll see if it does after the next reboot.  I did try "mimeset".).  Changed
	EnglishEditorApp::OpenFile() to handle these as XML files.
</change>
<change>
	Made EnglishEditorApp::RefsReceived() catch InvalidXMLException.
</change>
